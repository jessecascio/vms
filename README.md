Virtual Machine Clusters

From a development point of view, it is necessary to be able to quickly build and test different server architectures for development.  This repo builds various server architectures using Vagrant and Puppet that can quickly be spun up and developed on.

Prequisites:

Virtual Box
Vagrant

All conf files are written for CentOS VMs.  If you want to use a different distro you will have to update the Puppet conf files as well as the individual Vagrantfiles.
